/**
 * zombie.c
 *
 * This small program generates a zombie process.
 *
 * A zombie process is created when a process terminates,
 * but the parent does not invoke wait(), but the parent
 * continues to run. By not invoking wait(), the child
 * process maintains an entry in the process entry table
 * as well as maintaining its pid.
 *
 * Pretty simple to do:
 * 
 * (1) Create a child process
 * (2) Have the parent run for a specified amount of time.
 *
 * If this program is run in the background, the state of the child
 * process illustrates it is a zombie process.
 * (Z underneath the S field using ps)
